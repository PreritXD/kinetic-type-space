# Minimalist Personal Website with WebGL Background

A single-page personal website that blends technical precision with artistic expression.

## Design & Aesthetic
- **Dark theme** with monospace typography and subtle sans-serif accents
- **Minimal color palette**: near-black background, white/gray text, one accent color (subtle blue or violet)
- **Generous whitespace** with content centered and elegantly spaced

## WebGL Background
- Immersive particle field or noise-based shader using React Three Fiber
- Particles react subtly to mouse movement for depth
- Smooth, slow organic motion — feels alive but not distracting

## Content Sections (single scrollable page)
1. **Hero** — Name/title with large kinetic typography, animated entrance
2. **About** — Brief bio with fade-in-on-scroll text reveals
3. **Work/Projects** — Minimal grid or list with hover effects
4. **Contact** — Simple links (email, GitHub, etc.) with underline animations

## Motion & Interactions
- Smooth scroll-triggered text animations (fade + slide)
- Mouse-following parallax on the WebGL canvas
- Hover effects on links and project items
- Staggered entrance animations for content blocks

## Technical Approach
- React Three Fiber for the WebGL particle/shader background
- CSS animations + intersection observer for scroll reveals
- Monospace font (JetBrains Mono or similar) for headings, clean sans-serif for body
